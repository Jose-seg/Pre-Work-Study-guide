# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The motivation behind the project is to provide students, as well as myself, with a study guide online to help them through the pre-work or relect on anything that you might be struggling during the bootcamp.

- I built this project to give myself and other students a study guide that contains information that was learned in the pre-work.

- At the start I had many questions about the things I was learning, but the more I built this website I started to gain more insight in what I was learning.

- I learned how to apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when building a website, as well as working with git/github.
